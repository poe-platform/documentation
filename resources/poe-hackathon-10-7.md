# Poe Hackathon #1 (10/7)

As part of the launch of the [Poe API v2](https://quorablog.quora.com/Introducing-the-Poe-API-v2-for-Developers), you're invited to join the first official Poe hackathon on October 7th at 10AM PT! This will be your chance to build on top of the Poe platform and earn from a prize pool of $10k. You'll be able to talk to other participants and get support from the Poe team. We'll share more information as we approach the hackathon, so be sure to join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/B9GhuFwC) and leave a reaction in the #hackathon-subscribe channel for all the updates.
