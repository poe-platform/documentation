# Creator Monetization

### What is creator monetization?

The creator monetization program lets Poe bot creators get paid. The program compensates creators who bring users to Poe and onboard new subscribers with their bots, and will pay developers a fee per message to their bots. Check the Creators page for updates.

### How do I start earning?

**Join the program**\
Visit [poe.com](http://poe.com) via a desktop web browser. Navigate to Creators in the menu. Follow the steps to join creator monetization.\
\
**Share**\
Share your bots with your friends, on social media, or use any other marketing approach to help people discover them.\
\
**Adjust message limits**\
Control when to show paywalls by customizing message limits on each bot. Think about how many messages will engage the user so they are most likely to subscribe when they see the paywall.\
\
**Get paid**\
Earn money when:

* your bot brings a user to Poe for the first time and they eventually subscribe
* your bot brings a user back to Poe and they eventually subscribe
* your bot’s paywall is seen just before a user subscribes
* users send messages to your bot (starting soon)

**Check the Creators page**\
See which of your bots are performing the best.\
\
**Set your price**\
Soon you will be able to set your own price per bot message. To make the economics work, the more expensive a bot is, the more users will be limited in sending them messages, and some bots will only be available to subscribers. More details will be provided about this system soon.

### Who is eligible to be monetized?

Bot creators currently must be based in the United States. We are working to expand this program globally. Creators must agree to the [Poe Creator Monetization program terms and conditions](https://poe.com/earnings\_tos).

### How are earnings calculated?

There are two sources of earnings:

* Referral fees are paid when your bot causes a user to subscribe to Poe (active today)
* Per-message fees will be paid with every message sent to your bot (when this system starts operating)

Referral earnings come from each successfully converting "activation" or successfully converting "paywall."

* An activation is when your bot brings a user to Poe, and the activation successfully converts when that same user subscribes within a set period of time. There are two ways this can occur:
  * Your bot brings the user to Poe the first time they log in, and they subscribe within 14 days of that first visit.
  * Your bot brings the user back to Poe after they were inactive for 14+ days, and they subscribe within 14 days of returning.
    * We use a variety of mechanisms, including cookies and IP addresses, to track conversion of a user from first landing on Poe to sign up and ultimately subscription.
* A paywall is when a Poe user sees one of your bot’s paywalls, and the paywall successfully converts when that same user subscribes within a set period of time after seeing one of your bot's paywalls. Specifically:
  * A successful paywall occurs when your bot's paywall was the last one a user saw within 1 hour of subscribing.

Every time a person subscribes to Poe, we set aside $10 per monthly subscription or $20 per annual subscription. That full set-aside amount is split between any monetizing creators with successfully converting activations and successfully converting paywalls for that subscription. Bots that Poe creates itself- rather than bots made by creators on the platform- do not count for this purpose.\
\
For example, let's assume a user pays for a monthly subscription. As a result, Poe sets aside $10. We then check if a successful activation or a successful paywall led to that subscription.

* If creators’ bots had a successful activation (e.g., the user followed your social media post to Poe) but not a successful paywall (e.g., the user signed up in Poe Settings un-prompted), then the activating bot's developer would earn the full $10.
* If creators’ bots had both a successful activation and a successful paywall, then each bot's developer would earn $5 ($10 divided by the two successes).
  * If one developer made both bots (or it's the same bot), then that developer would earn the full $10.
* If no creators’ bots had successfully converting activations or paywalls, then the $10 is not paid out.

Earnings are displayed in the Bot Analytics section of the Creators page. Actual earnings paid out under the program may differ based on adjustments described in the creator monetization program terms and conditions (e.g., a subscriber ultimately not paying). Refer to your payout reports and Stripe account for accurate actual earnings data.

### How do I receive payments?

Complete your account setup on Stripe to receive payouts. After joining creator monetization, navigate to the Creators page and follow the instructions to connect to our payment processor. Fill in your taxpayer information within 90 days of joining the program to be eligible for payments. You will receive payments through your Stripe account.

### When will I receive payments?

Assuming you are eligible, have joined creator monetization, completed all required information, and remain in good standing, you will become eligible for a payment when you have earnings of $10+ to be paid. Payments are made the first week of each month, and payments are made within 35 days of the end of the month when the subscription occurred. See the [terms and conditions](https://poe.com/earnings\_tos) for full details.

### **What can I do to have more successful activations?**

First, create bots that people love using and want to share, and enroll in creator monetization. Then, share your bots with friends and anyone else who will appreciate them. Social media can be an effective channel to reach a large audience, or you can experiment with any other marketing technique.

### **What can I do to have more successful paywalls?**

After joining creator monetization, every one of your bots will have a monetization control. That control sets the maximum number of messages a user can send to your bot before seeing a paywall. To maximize revenue, you will likely want to find a balance between giving users the ability to try your bot out for free and making sure your bot’s heavier users end up seeing a paywall from your bot. Test different maximum message limits to find what works best.

### **How do I edit the message limit of your bots?**

You can edit the message limit during new bot creation or bot editing. This feature is currently only available on [poe.com](http://poe.com) via a desktop web browser. You will not be able to customize bot message limits on your mobile device.
