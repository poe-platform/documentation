# How to get distribution

In order for a bot to be recommended to other users by Poe, it needs to have a profile picture and a description. You can edit these on the Edit bot screen. The more likely people are to use your bot and continue to use it over time, the more likely Poe will be to recommend it.

Your bot will be available to everyone at poe.com/\<handle>. You can recommend your bot to your friends or followers on other platforms by sharing the link, or by telling them to go to Poe and search for the bot's handle. The more people you drive to your bot from outside of Poe, the more likely Poe will be to recommend it on-platform.
