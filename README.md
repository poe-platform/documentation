# Welcome to Poe for Developers

Poe is a platform for interacting with bots. In addition to providing access to popular bots, Poe also allows Developers to create new bots.

### Why you should create a bot on Poe?

* **Costs**: Developing a publicly available bot powered by large language models is prohibitively expensive for most, but creating a bot on Poe allows you to offload those astronomical costs and makes your bot financially viable.
* **Distribution**: Poe's bot recommendation system allows you to reach a large audience for your bot for free.
* **Multiplatform UI**: Poe's presence on all the major platforms (web, iOS, android, macbook etc) means that your users have a great experience with your bot no matter what machine they are on.
* **Social features**: Users can conveniently share a chat with your bot both internally on Poe and externally leading to even more exposure for your bot.

### How do I create a bot on Poe?

We provide two different developer products and depending on your needs and use-case, one or the other might be a better fit for you.

* **Prompt bots**: These allow you to create a bot on top of other bots (for example ChatGPT, Claude-instant etc) by providing plain-text instructions that the bot will stick to during conversation with users. To learn how to build a prompt bot, check out our [prompt bot tutorial](prompt-bots/how-to-create-a-prompt-bot.md).
* **Server bots**: These allow you to create a bot powered by a custom backend that runs your code in response to every user message. In addition, building a server bot with Poe allows you to access any other LLM on Poe for free, which can significantly enhance the capabilities of your bot without you having to incur a large cost. To learn how to build a server bot, check out our [quick start](server-bots/quick-start.md).
