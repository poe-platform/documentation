# Welcome to Poe for Developers

Poe for developers aims to be the fastest and most efficient way for you to create a chatbot and share it with your friends or followers. We support two different products:

* [**Prompt bots**](prompt-bots/how-to-create-a-prompt-bot.md) allow you to create a chatbot on top of ChatGPT or Claude-instant by providing plain-text instructions that the bot will stick to during conversation with users.
* [**Server bots**](server-bots/quick-start.md) allow you to create a chatbot powered by your custom backend that runs your code in response to every user message. Server bots are aimed at more tech savvy developers; they are more work to set up but offer a lot more flexibility in terms of what you can achieve with them.
